# Coding-Quiz

A simple quiz app on coding. When the user starts, the game, a timer is set for 75 seconds. If the user clicks on the correct multiple choice answer, they are taken to the next question on a new page. If they answer incorrectly, they are taken to the next question and penalized 10 seconds. The game is over when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. The score is the time left after all questions have been answered. At the end of the game, the user is presented with their score and a text area to input their initials, as well as buttons to save and display high scores.
