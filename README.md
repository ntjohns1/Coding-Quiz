# Coding-Quiz
AS A coding boot camp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz, WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question. 
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly. THEN time is subtracted from the clock.
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over.
WHEN the game is over, THEN I can save my initials and my score.
